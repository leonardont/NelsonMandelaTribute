            Nelson Mandela (1918-2013) was a South African political activist who lost 27 years of his life in prison due to his opposition to the apartheid regime, 
            covered in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid" target="_blank">this link.</a> He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and is considered the most important 
            leader of the Sub-Saharan Africa, where he is normally referred as Madiba (the name of his clan) or "Tata" (father).

            Childhood (1918â€“1934)

            <p id="subtext1">
            Born on 18 July 1918 in Umtata, Mandela was given the forename Rolihlahla, a Xhosa term meaning "troublemaker", but later he became known by his clan 
            name, Madiba. His early life was dominated by traditional Thembu customs and taboos, growing up with two sisters in his mother's homestead where he 
            tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent time with other boys. Mandela was then baptised a Methodist, when his teacher gave him the english forename of 
            "Nelson".

            During his time in University, Mandela became completely aware of racial inequality and injustice faced by non-white people. In 1943, he joined ANC 
            (African National Congress) and actively took part against the apartheid. Being one of the most qualified, Nelson was in great demand and being fully 
            commited to the cause, which promoted him through the ranks of the ANC. In 1956, Mandela and several other members of the ANC were arrested and charged, 
            but finally acquitted in 1961. The ANC was banned and Mandela suggested an armed resistance against the apartheid. This revolution formed the Umkhonto 
            we Sizwe, a guerilla resistance, receiving training in African countries and sabotaging the apartheid. In 1963, he was again arrested and put on trial 
            for treason. Nelson Mandela received a death sentence, which was then commuted to life imprisonment. He was incarcerated from 1964 until 1990.

            Mandela was released in 11 February 1990. This day was a huge event for the world, since his release symbolized the impending end of the apartheid.
            In April 1994, South Africa had its first full elections, with the ANC winning by 65% of the vote. Nelson Mandela became the first President of the 
            new South Africa. In 1999, he retired from the Presidency, to be succeeded by Thabo Mbeki. Nelson rarely publicly expressed his opinions about world 
            affairs after his retirement, and said that preferred to spend more time with his wife, children and grandchildren. Nelson Mandela died on 5 December 2013 
            at the age of 95, after a long illness with his family by his side.
